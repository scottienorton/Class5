<div class=info1><p><br><br><br><h1>Taeko Ohnuki</h1><br>
    Taeko Ohnuki is a Japanese Singer-songwriter who rose to popularity in the late seventies.<br>
    Born in Tokyo in 1953, Ohnuki grew up listening to foreign music and playing in small bands.<br>
    Taeko would go on to have a career spanning over decades and work with some of the most<br> 
    influential Japanese producers of all time. Her music has helped define the city pop genre.
     <blockquote>"There were these gaps that weren’t filled up by any rules.<br>I was able to experiment with interesting ideas back then...<br>Now, you can’t do that. Those gaps have been filled.."</blockquote>
    Here you'll find a guide to Taeko's beginnings and career, through her most popular albums and eras!

<div class=main>
<div id=album1 class=infoleft><p><br><br></a><h3>Sunshower</h3><br>
    Taeko formed a band called <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Sugar Babe</span> in 1975<br>
    with the "king" of City Pop, Tatsuro Yamashita. Because this<br> 
    "poppy" type of music was not popular at the time, the band broke up<br>
    and she went solo. Her second solo album, Sunshower, released in 1977,<br>
    combined elements of pop and Jazz. At the time it was a commercial failure<br>
    but would later garner critical acclaim. My favorite track is <span style= "color: #89ffd4">"Tokai"</span>.<br><br><a id=mignonne></a></p>

<div id=album2 class=inforight style= "text-shadow:2px 2px 2px black"><br><br><p><h3 style= "text-shadow:3px 3px 3px black">Mignonne</h3><br>
    For her third album, Mignonne, Taeko worked with producer<br> 
    Eeji Ogura. Because the focus was more on sales, and the album<br> 
    wasn't as successful as hoped, Taeko took a two year break from music.<br>
    <blockquote>"Either you sell or you don’t sell. Who knows?<br>
        But if you personally aren’t happy with what<br>
        you are making, there’s no point."</blockquote>
    Still, this album spawned the classic <span style= "color: #89ffd4">"4:00am"</span>, arguably her biggest commercial hit.<br><a id=cliche></a></p>

<div class=main>
    <div id=album3 class=infoleft><p><br><br></a><h3>Cliche</h3><br>Starting in 1980, Taeko began releasing her "Europe" trilogy of albums,<br>
        <span style= "color: #89ffd4"> Romantique</span>, <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Aventure</span>, and <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Cliche</span>. These albums had a more western<br>
        sound and were heavily inspired by French soundtracks and movies.<br>
    For these albums, she worked heavily with the members of<br>
    <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Yellow Magic Orchestra</span>, another group influential in the<br>
    City Pop Genre. Her sound shifted to a more electronic sound.<br>
    <span style= "color: #89ffd4">"Labyrinth"</span> from Cliche is a favorite of mine.<br><a id=copine></a>

    <div class=inforight id=album4><br><br><p><h3>Copine</h3><br>
        During the 80's, many of Taeko's songs had themes from<br>
        children's books, like Cliche's <span style= "color: #89ffd4">"Peter Rabbit to Watashi"</span>and the<br>
        song <span style= "color: #89ffd4">"les Adventures de Tintin"</span> from 1985's Copine. Taeko<br>
        continued to experiment with her sound throughout the 90's<br>
        and was inspired by her travels around the world. A trip to <br>
        Brazil, in particular, would inspire the more rythmic sound of 1995's<br>
        <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Tchou</span>. Throughout the next decade, she would continue <br>
to work with her frequent collaborator Ryuichi Sakamoto of YMO.</p><a id=legacy></a>

        Since 1987 with her first 'Pure Acoustic' solo concert in Suntory Hall,<br>
        Ohnuki has performed both pop band and acoustic concerts all over Japan.<br>
        She has released 27 solo albums in total, and has written songs for soundtracks<br>
        from movies such as 1996's <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Shall We Dance</span> and 2006's <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Animal Crossing: The Movie.</span><br>
        With the increased international interest in the City Pop genre over the last few years,<br>
        a new audience is finally discovering Taeko's music for the first time.<br></p>
