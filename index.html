<div class=info1><a id=top></a><p><br><br><br><br><br><br>Taeko Ohnuki is a Japanese Singer-songwriter who rose to popularity in the late seventies. Her music has
    helped define the city pop genre.

<div class=infoleft><p><br><br><br><br><br></a>Taeko formed a band called <span style= "color: #89ffd4">Sugar Babe</span> in 1975<br>
    which combined elements of Jazz and Pop. Because this type of<br>
    music was not popular at the time, the band broke up. Her second<br>
    solo album, Sunshower, released in 1977, was a commercial failure<br>
    but would later garner critical acclaim. My favorite track is Tokai.</p>

<div class=inforight><p>For her third album, Mignonne, Taeko worked with producer Eji Ogura.<br>
    Becuase the focus was more on sales, and the album wasn't as<br>
    successful as hoped, Taeko took a two year break from music.<br>
    Still, this album spawned the classic "4:00am", arguably her biggest commercial hit.</p>
